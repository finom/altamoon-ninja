> Half-automated experimental strategies for Altamoon

There is only one feature by the time being. It's so-called "bounced order".

The tool automatically opens a Buy market order of given size once bull-ish Heikin-Ashi candle appears in Buy mode and opens a Sell market order once bear-ish candle appears in Sell mode. Bounced order becomes disabled once order is placed.

The tool can be useful for parabolic price changes only. **Use at your own risk!**
