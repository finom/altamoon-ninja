The tool automatically opens a Buy market order of given size once bull-ish Heikin-Ashi candle appears in Buy mode and opens a Sell market order once bear-ish candle appears in Sell mode. Bounced order becomes disabled automatically once order is placed.

The tool can be useful for parabolic price changes only. **Use at your own risk!**
